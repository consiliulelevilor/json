JSON is a repo that is gathering as much data as possible in JSON, like institutions (schools) or regions from Romania.

# Tips
All files should be `*.json` files and minifed.

# Contributing
If you wish to update them, deminify, modify and minify it again using online JSON minifiers. In the PR, note the notable changes.
